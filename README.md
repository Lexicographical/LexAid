Lex-Aid: A reading tool for the people

Lex-Aid is a reading tool for the people. The code will run on a Raspberry Pi to detect text on documents or pictures using optical character recognition (OCR) through the open-source library, Tesseract. If run on a computer, you can also run the sign language recognition feature which makes use of a convolutional neural network trained with TensorFlow and Keras.
